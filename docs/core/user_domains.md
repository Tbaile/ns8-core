# User domains

Users and groups are stored in an LDAP database, served by one **account
provider module**. Multiple modules can work together to serve the same
LDAP database as replicas of it. An LDAP database represents an account
**domain**.

A NS8 cluster can host multiple account domains from different
implementations. It is possible to configure and connect external LDAP
services, too. Supported LDAP schema are

1. `ad` - Active Directory
2. `rfc2307`

## LDAP service discovery

A module can discover the list of available account domains with the
`agent.ldapproxy` Python module. The following command dumps a list of
parameters required to connect with an LDAP database on cluster node 1.

    runagent python3 -magent.ldapproxy

Returned TCP endpoints are local (`host` is `127.0.0.1`) and do not
require TLS. The port number depends on the LDAP domain.

Those ports are held by the [Ldapproxy
module](https://github.com/NethServer/ns8-core/blob/main/ldapproxy/README.md).
It is a L4 proxy that relays the TCP connection to an LDAP backend server,
enabling TLS and handling backend failures as needed.

If the LDAP client module runs in a Podman container with a
`private` network, add the following arguments to the `podman run`
command:

    --network=slirp4netns:allow_host_loopback=true

Then replace `127.0.0.1` with the special `10.0.2.2` IP address, that is
translated by Podman back to the loopback device, 127.0.0.1 on the root
network namespace.

Python code example:

```python
from agent.ldapproxy import Ldapproxy
lp = Ldapproxy()
domains = lp.get_domains_list()
print(domains)
domain = lp.get_domain("mydomain")
print(domain)
```

The module can handle the user domain configuration changes by defining an
event handler. Create an executable script with path
`${AGENT_INSTALL_DIR}/events/user-domain-changed/10handler`. For instance:

```shell
read -r domain < <(jq -r .domain)
if [[ "${domain}" == "mydomain" ]]; then
    systemctl --user reload mymodule.service
fi
```

## List users and groups

Once LDAP connection parameters are retrieved with the `agent.ldapproxy`
Python package, it is easy to get user and group listings with the
`agent.ldapclient` package.

This is an excerpt from the `cluster/list-domain-groups` API implementation:

```python
from agent.ldapproxy import Ldapproxy
from agent.ldapclient import Ldapclient

domparams = Ldapproxy().get_domain('mydom.test')
groups = Ldapclient.factory(**domparams).list_groups()
```

For complete examples see the API implementation of

- `cluster/list-domain-groups`
- `cluster/list-domain-users`
- `cluster/get-domain-user`
- `cluster/get-domain-group`

## Hidden users and groups

Some users and/or groups can be hidden to UI and other applications.

Applications might need to build LDAP search filters to configure user and
groups. The `Ldapproxy` library provides some methods that return filter
strings that honor the user and group lists used by the core. For example:

```python
from agent.ldapproxy import Ldapproxy
lp = Ldapproxy()
users_filter = lp.get_ldap_users_search_filter_clause("mydomain")
print(users_filter)
groups_filter = lp.get_ldap_groups_search_filter_clause("mydomain")
print(groups_filter)
```

## Bind modules and account domains

If a module wants to use an account domain it must execute a bind
procedure, so the core is aware of existing relations between modules and
account domains. When such relations are formally established the core can

- limit/grant access to LDAP resources
- show the relations in the web user interfaces

For example, a module that uses one domain at a time can unbind the old
domain and bind the new one with a script like this:

```python
import agent
import json
import os
import sys

request = json.load(sys.stdin)

# The old domain is unbound
agent.unbind_user_domain(os.getenv("LDAP_USER_DOMAIN", ""))

# The new domain is bound
agent.bind_user_domain(request["ldap_domain"])

agent.set_env("LDAP_USER_DOMAIN", request["ldap_domain"])
```

When the module or the domain is removed from the cluster, the relation
cleanup occurs automatically.

If the module wants to be notified of any change to the relation between
modules and user domains it can subscribe the `module-domain-changed`
event. For instance, this is the payload of such event:

```json
{
    "modules": ["mymodule1"],
    "domains": ["mydomain.test"]
}
```

The following Python excerpt checks if the module domain was changed:

```python
event = json.load(sys.stdin)
if not os.environ["LDAP_USER_DOMAIN"] in event["domains"]:
    sys.exit(0) # nothing to do if our domain is among affected domains

# Handle the event by some means, for example
# - rewrite some config file
# - reload some service running in a container
```
